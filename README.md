# README-repo

## General information

This repo is for demonstrating how to edit a README.

This repo is mine (GitHub username: an-bui).

## Data and file information

There are two folders, a `code` folder and a `data` folder. All code is in the `code` folder, and all datasets are in the `data` folder.  

In the code folder, there is a file called `test-code.qmd` that contains all code for this analysis.
